# Trackers

The NHS Digital Technical Assessment – Data Protection section of the DAQ aims to establishing that health apps and digital tools handle personal information in a safe, fair and lawful way.

NHS Digital require developers of apps and digital tools:

- to provide details of trackers (software meant to collect data about the user or their online actions) with a justification why each is required, what the purpose of each is and the legal basis (e.g. consent for such processing)
- to provide a DPIA that includes details of trackers and permissions used in a product along with the justification for why each is required and their purpose. (If there are no trackers or permissions used in a product, this is clearly stated in the DPIA.)
- to make users aware of the trackers/permissions in a product's privacy notice.
