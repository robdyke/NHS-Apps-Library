# Trackers

## What is a tracker?

A tracker is a piece of software whose task is to gather information on the person using the application, on how they use it, or on the smartphone being used. A tracker is usually distributed by companies as a SDK (Software Development Kit), a sort of ready-made toolkit, aiming to make it easier for application developers. To be noted : 'open source' trackers exist, their code is available and open to everyone.

## What do NHS Digital assess?

NHS Digital require developers of apps and digital tools:

- to provide details of trackers (software meant to collect data about the user or their online actions) with a justification why each is required, what the purpose of each is and the legal basis (e.g. consent for such processing)
- to provide a DPIA that includes details of trackers and permissions used in a product along with the justification for why each is required and their purpose. (If there are no trackers or permissions used in a product, this is clearly stated in the DPIA.)
- to make users aware of the trackers/permissions in a product's privacy notice.
