                      Under Data Protection legislation, organisations must be

                      A DPIA is a tool that enables organisations to identify

                      activities before the processing begins. A comprehensive
                      DPIA is required which covers the criteria set out in
                      European guidelines (Annex 2) and additionally covers

                      First Party A first party cookie can only be created and
                      viewed by the operator of a website a user is visiting.
                      These cookies are often used so that a website recognises
                      the user and automatically applies the userâ€™s desired
                      settings (e.g. which language to display). Website owners
                      may also use the data gathered for analytics or their own
                      online marketing. Third Party Third party web tracking
                      refers to cookies (and other methods that perform the same
                      function e.g. Flash cookie, Server log: Web beacons,
                      tracking pixels) that are generated by external sites and
                      track a userâ€™s journey across different websites. This
                      information may be used for analytics, but more commonly
                      it is used for targeted marketing (e.g. to direct and
                      display advertisements to the individual as a potential
                      customer). Under EU/UK Data Protection legislation,
                      tracking may only take place if the individual has given
                      their valid consent (e.g. the user has been made aware of
                      any party that may collect, receive, or use the end usersâ€™
                      personal data as a consequence of your use of a tracker.
                      You must also provide users with prominent and easily
                      accessible information about the third partyâ€™s use of
                      usersâ€™ personal data. Tracking is not anonymous. A tracker
                      may not have the individualâ€™s name but is able to identify
                      the user (e.g. in order to deliver targeted advertising).
                      Consent is therefore required before this personal data is
                      collected.
